- 👋 Hi, I’m @A-Porter1250
- 👀 I’m interested in implementing mechanical engineering calculations with programming languages and see if I can apply these principles easily to different problems. I also like to play piano🎵
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and JavaScript, more of VBA and maybe some HTML if I'm bored. Also a fluids and thermo stuff.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on python codes, engineering things or cool excel things.
- 📫 How to reach me: message me on here if you'd like 😊
