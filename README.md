Hello, I'm @A-Porter1250

I'm a mechanical engineering student, interested in implimenting concepts in python to improve my modeling engineering experience and improve my understaning of engineering fundementals.

I've been constantly working towards improving my python experience since I started learning it in the spring of 2023
I started transitioning from VBA to python to improve my versitility in the processing, analysis, and modeling of engineering problems.

Im hoping to collaborate with other engineres with experience in python, or mechanical systems to develop useful and interesting models.
